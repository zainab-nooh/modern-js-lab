# ![Modern Javascript Syntax Lab - Exercise](./assets/hero.png)

## Introduction

Over the last decade, JavaScript has seen significant changes in its syntax to make it more user-friendly, responding to developers' needs. These updates have become standard in popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. It’s key to understand that these changes primarily enhance coding efficiency rather than add new functionality to the language.

## Learning goals:

This lab is your opportunity to dive into modern JavaScript syntax. Understanding this contemporary style is beneficial, but a solid grasp of traditional JavaScript is essential. It lays a strong foundation not only for JavaScript but also for learning other programming languages. Remember, not all languages offer such syntax shortcuts. As a developer, you will encounter languages with unique characteristics, but they often share foundational concepts with JavaScript. Mastering modern JavaScript syntax without relying on it as a crutch is crucial. This approach ensures you’re well-prepared to adapt to different programming languages without starting from scratch.

## Lab structure

Each **Review section** will provide a brief explanation of a modern JS concept followed by an **exercise** to complete.

## Review: `Array.prototype.map()`

The `Array.prototype.map()` method returns a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in an existing array. This allows for the transformation of each element inside the array, without altering the original.

Take a look at the example below:

```javascript
const array1 = ['vanilla', 'chocolate', 'strawberry'];

const array2 = array1.map((currentElement) => {
  return currentElement + ' ice cream';
});

console.log(array2); // ['vanilla ice cream', 'chocolate ice cream', 'strawberry ice cream']
```

In this example, we've used the `Array.prototype.map()` method on `array1` to generate `array2`. Each element in `array2` is the result of appending `' ice cream'` to the end of a string element in `array1`.

The `Array.prototype.map()` method is used to iterate over `array1`. For every element in `array1`, it will call upon the provided function. When the function is called upon, it receives the current element being processed as an argument. The value returned from the function will take the place of the original element in the new array.

> 💡 `Array.prototype.map()` returns a **new array** with altered values. It does _not_ alter the original array.

### Exercise 1: Applying `Array.prototype.map()`

```js
// Use `.map()` to iterate over the following array:

const nums = [13, 87, 2, 89, 12, 4, 90, 63];

// Create a new array where each value is multiplied by 2 and log the new array.

// Your code here
```

## Review: Array destructuring

Array destructuring in JavaScript is a way of unpacking the elements of an array. With array destructuring, we can extract elements from an array and store them in variables with a single line of code.

When we destructure an array, the elements are matched positionally with the variables we define, meaning the order in which we declare variables corresponds with the order of elements in the array.

```javascript
const petsArray = ['Rover', 'Snuffles', 'Toto', 'Spot'];

const [firstPet, secondPet] = petsArray;

console.log(firstPet); // 'Rover'
console.log(secondPet); // 'Snuffles'

// Equivalent in traditional bracket notation:
console.log(petsArray[0]); // 'Rover'
console.log(petsArray[1]); // 'Snuffles'
```

In the example above, the first two elements of `petsArray` are unpacked into `firstPet` and `secondPet`.

> 💡 You have full control of the variable names!

### Exercise 2: Array destructuring

```js
// Given the following array, use destructuring to pull out the first and second values and place them into variables. Log both variables.

const pizzaToppings = ['Pineapple', 'Olives', 'Anchovies'];

// Your code here
```

## Review: Object destructuring

Destructuring can also be applied to objects. With object destructuring, we can extract properties from an object. Instead of accessing properties through dot notation or bracket notation, the values of specific properties in an object can be assigned to variables.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alex',
  role: 'Software Engineer',
};

// Object destructuring:
const { name, role } = person;

console.log(name); // 'Alex'
console.log(role); // 'Software Engineer'

// Equivalent in traditional dot notation:
console.log(person.name); // 'Alex'
console.log(person.role); // 'Software Engineer'
```

In the example above, the `person` object is deconstructed to extract the `name` and `role` properties. This approach allows us to access the values of `name` and `role` without having to use dot notation for each property.

> 🚨 Unlike array destructuring, where elements are matched based on their position, the variables created in object destructuring, such as `const { name, role }`, need to match the names of existing properties in the object.

### Exercise 3: Destructuring objects

```js
// Given the following object, use destructuring to create variables `make` and `model` that will hold the respective values.

const car = {
  make: 'Audi',
  model: 'q5',
};

// Your code here
```

## Review: Applying the spread operator on arrays

The spread operator (`...`) gives us a way to duplicate or combine arrays. Instead of manually copying elements from one array to another using loops, the spread operator allows us to directly copy the elements of one array into another.

```javascript
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const duplicateArray = [...originalArray];

console.log(duplicateArray); // [1, 2, 3]
```

In the example above, `duplicateArray` is an entirely separate array produced by copying the contents of `originalArray`.

This differs from simply assigning one array to another, which only creates a reference, not a copy:

```javascript
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const referenceArray = originalArray; // referenceArray is now a reference to originalArray

referenceArray.push(4); // Modifying referenceArray also modifies originalArray
console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The spread operator prevents this issue by ensuring the new array is an independent copy that shares no references with the original. This can be useful when we need to maintain the immutability of the original array.

The spread operator can also merge multiple arrays into one:

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'];
const vegetables = ['broccoli', 'carrot', 'spinach'];

const fruitsAndVegetables = [...fruits, ...vegetables];

console.log(fruitsAndVegetables); // ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'broccoli', 'carrot', 'spinach']
```

> 🚨 When merging multiple arrays, be sure to include the spread operator. Not doing so can result in unintentional nesting.

### Exercise 4: Applying the spread operator on arrays

```js
// Duplicate the following array using the spread operator and assign it to `controversialPizzaToppings`. Then, log the variable.

const pizzaToppings = ['Pineapple', 'Olives', 'Anchovies'];

// Your code here
```

## Review: Applying the spread operator on objects

The spread operator can also be applied to objects:

```javascript
const originalObject = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 100,
};

const clonedObject = { ...originalObject };
console.log('Clone: ', clonedObject); // { foo: 'Hello', bar: 100 }
```

In the example above, we can see how the properties of `originalObject` have been copied over into a new object called `clonedObject`.

The use of the spread operator here differs significantly from direct assignment:

```javascript
const originalObject = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 100,
};

const clonedObject = originalObject;
clonedObject.foo = 'Goodbye';

console.log(originalObject); // { foo: 'Goodbye', bar: 100 }
```

The example above demonstrates a pitfall of attempting to clone an object **without the spread operator**. When `clonedObject` is assigned `originalObject` directly, it doesn't actually create a new, independent object. Instead, `clonedObject` becomes a reference to `originalObject`. This means any changes made to `clonedObject` also affect `originalObject`, as they both point to the same data.

Like with Arrays, this issue can be remedied when we apply the spread operator:

```javascript
const originalObject = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 100,
};

// Copy the properties of originalObject:
const clonedObject = { ...originalObject };

// Update the properties of clonedObject:
clonedObject.foo = 'Goodbye';
clonedObject.bar = 0;

console.log('Original: ', originalObject); // { foo: 'Hello', bar: 100 }
console.log('Clone: ', clonedObject); // { foo: 'Goodbye', bar: 0 }
```

With the spread operator, `clonedObject` is a brand new object, with its own separate copy of the data from `originalObject`. Now, modifying `clonedObject` will not impact the `originalObject`

### Exercise 5: Applying the spread operator on objects

```js
// Duplicate the following object and spread its values into a new variable `myCar`.

const car = {
  make: 'Audi',
  model: 'q5',
};

// Change the `model` property of `myCar` to 'q7'. Log both objects.

// Your code here
```

## Review: Dynamic keys in objects

Through bracket notation, variables and expressions can be used as dynamic keys in an object. Dynamic keys can be used to create, access, and modify properties in an object. Dynamic keys enhance our ability to access data. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where key names are not known ahead of time or when they need to be computed on the fly. It also allows for more concise and readable code, avoiding the need for additional steps when assigning properties to objects.

Take for example, the use of `selectedFruit` as a dynamic key in the codeblock below:

```javascript
const fruitInventory = {
  apples: 2,
  oranges: 4,
};

const selectedFruit = 'apples'; // Variable as a dynamic key
const selectedFruitCount = fruitInventory[selectedFruit];

console.log(selectedFruitCount); // 2
```

This technique can be extended to the creation of objects, where property names are determined dynamically:

```javascript
const fruitType = 'bananas'; // Variable as a dynamic key

const fruitInventory = {
  [fruitType]: 5,
};

console.log(fruitInventory); // { bananas: 5 }
```

Using square brackets (`[]`) around `fruitType` in the object declaration tells JavaScript to use the variable's value as the property name. Without the brackets, the string `'fruitType'` would be used as the key, rather than its value (`'bananas'`).

### Exercise 6: Dynamic keys in objects

```js
// Create an object named userProfile. 
// Define a variable named propertyName and assign a string to it (like a username, age, or email). 
// Use propertyName as a dynamic key in userProfile, assigning a relevant value.

// Your code here
```

## Review: `import` and `export`

In JavaScript, the `import` and `export` syntax allows us to share code between different files. This is a more modern approach compared to the `require` and `module.exports` syntax used in CommonJS.

With `export`, you can make functions, objects, or primitives available for use in other files.

There are two main types of exports:

1. **Named exports**: For exporting multiple items from a file:

```javascript
export const myNumber = 123;
export const myString = 'Hello';
```

2. **Default exports**: For exporting a single item from a file:

```javascript
export default function superCoolFunction() {
  /* ... */
}
```

> 🏆 It's possible to mix default and named exports in a single module, but it's a best practice to stick to one style for consistency and clarity.

Using `import`, you can bring those exported items into another file.

1. **Importing named exports**:

```javascript
import { myNumber, myString } from './myData.js';
```

2. **Importing a default export**:

```javascript
import superCoolFunction from './superCoolFunction.js';
```

You can also import all named exports as a single object, which is useful when dealing with modules that export several items:

```javascript
import * as MyData from './myData.js';
console.log(MyData.myNumber);
console.log(MyData.myString);
```

This allows for more organized code by separating concerns into modules.

### Exercise 7: Import and Export

Follow the steps below for some practice with `import` and `export`. Update the values for `default`, `age`, and `job` accordingly:

1. Initialize a node project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

2. Add the following property to `package.json`:

```json
"type":"module",
```

3. Create two files: `exportingFile.js` and `importingFile.js`:

```bash
touch exportingFile.js
touch importingFile.js
```

4. In `exportingFile.js` add the following:

```javascript
export default 'Matt';
```

5. In `importingFile.js` add the following:

```javascript
import name from './exportingFile.js';
console.log(name);
```

6. Run `importingFile.js` like so:

```bash
node importingFile.js
```

7. To export additional values, update `exportingFile.js` like so:

```javascript
export default 'Matt';
export const age = 43;
export const job = 'programmer';
```

These additions can be imported by updating `importingFile.js` like so:

```javascript
import name, { age, job } from './exportingFile.js';
console.log(name, age, job);
```

## Review: Default parameters

Default parameters are just that - default values for parameters. These defaults are applied when no value is passed for those parameters during a function call.

Take this example:

```javascript
function addThreeNumbers(numA, numB, numC) {
  return numA + numB + numC;
}

addThreeNumbers(2);
```

This will return `NaN`, because the value of `numB` and `numC` are both `undefined`. Let’s apply some defaults to the `numB` and `numC` parameters:

```js
function addThreeNumbers(numA, numB = 2, numC = 1) {
  return numA + numB + numC;
}

addThreeNumbers(2);
```

Now this function will return the number `5`. What if we also give a default to `numA`?

```js
function addThreeNumbers(numA = 1, numB = 2, numC = 1) {
  return numA + numB + numC;
}

addThreeNumbers(2);
```

This function is still going to return the number `5`. The default value of `1` on `numA` will be overridden by the passed in value of `2`.

### Exercise 8: Default parameters

```js
// Create a function that takes two parameters, `noun` and `adjective`, both with the following respective default values:

// 1. `cat`

// 2. `white`

// The function should log a sentence 'The cat is white.' by default. The function should substitute the appropriate parameters when supplied arguments.

// Your code here
```

## Review: The ternary operator

The ternary operator gives us a way to handle conditional logic in a single line of code. Ternaries can be viewed as a more concise version of an `if...else` statement. It can also simplify the process of assigning a value to a variable based on a condition.

A ternary consists of three parts:

1. **Condition**: A boolean expression evaluated for truthiness, placed before the `?`.
2. **True Expression**: The value assigned to the variable if the condition is `true`, located immediately after the `?`.
3. **False Expression**: The value assigned to the variable if the condition is `false`, following the `:`.

Consider the following example using an `if...else` statement:

```javascript
const age = 22;
let access;

if (age > 21) {
  access = 'Yes';
} else {
  access = 'No';
}

console.log(access); // 'Yes'
```

This logic can be streamlined using a ternary:

```javascript
const age = 22;
let access = age > 21 ? 'Yes' : 'No';

console.log(access); // 'Yes'
```

> 💡 The ternary operator is a powerful tool for simplifying conditional expressions, making it ideal for straightforward assignments based on a single condition.

### Exercise 9: Ternary operator

```js
// Convert the following `if...else` statement in to a ternary:

let pizza = 'tasty';

if (pizza === 'tasty') {
  console.log('yum');
} else {
  console.log('yuck');
}

// Your code here
```

## Review: Boolean gates

Logical operators such as `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) play an interesting role when used outside of `if...else` statements. In this context, they can be used to evaluate and return values directly, based on the truthiness or falsiness of the values involved.

1. **The `&&` operator**

The `&&` operator evaluates expressions from left to right and returns the **first falsy value** it encounters. If all values are truthy, it returns the last value.

Let's take a look at a few examples of the `&&` operator at work:

- When the first expression (`false`) being evaluated is falsy, and `result` will be assigned that value (`false`).

  ```javascript
  const result = false && 'foo';
  console.log(result); // Output: false
  ```

- When the first value is truthy (`'hello'`) and the second value is falsy (`''`), the `result` is assigned the empty string (`''`), as it is the first falsy value encountered.

  ```javascript
  const result = 'hello' && '';
  console.log(result); // Output: ''
  ```

- When both values are truthy, the result is the value of the last expression (`'bar'`).

  ```javascript
  const result = 'foo' && 'bar';
  console.log(result); // Output: 'bar'
  ```

> 💡 Remember, in JavaScript, falsy values include `''` (empty strings), `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and `false`. Everything else is considered truthy.

2. **The `||` operator**

The `||` operator evaluates expressions from left to right and returns the **first truthy value** it encounters. If all values are falsy, it returns the last value.

Let's take a look at a few examples of the `||` operator at work:

- When the first expression (`''`) is falsy, `result` is assigned `'foo'` as it's the first truthy value.

  ```javascript
  const result = '' || 'foo';
  console.log(result); // Output: 'foo'
  ```

- If the first value (`2`) is truthy, the evaluation stops, and `result` is assigned the first value (`2`).

  ```javascript
  const result = 2 || 0;
  console.log(result); // Output: 2
  ```

- When all values being evaluated are falsy (`''` and `0`), `result` is assigned the last value (`0`), as no truthy value is found.

  ```javascript
  const result = '' || 0;
  console.log(result); // Output: 0
  ```

> 💡 The `||` operator can be helpful for setting fallback or default values.

Can you guess what the values of the variables will be:

```javascript
const result1 = 'bar' && 'foo';
const result2 = false || 243;
const result3 = 42 && false;
const result3 = myVar || 3000;

console.log('result1:', result1);
console.log('result1:', result2);
console.log('result1:', result3);
console.log('result1:', result4);
```

### Exercise 10: Boolean gates

```js
// Simulated language configuration (change this variable to test)
const localLangConfig = null; // Change to 'es', 'fr', etc., or keep it null

// Create a variable called LANG
// Assign LANG the value of localLangConfig or 'en' as a default

// Your code here

// Log the result
console.log('Language setting:', LANG);

// Simulated user theme preference (change this variable to test)
const userSavedTheme = null; // Change to 'dark', 'contrast', etc., or keep it null

// Create a variable called USER_THEME
// Assign USER_THEME the value of userSavedTheme or 'light' as a default

// Your code here

// Log the result
console.log('User theme setting:', USER_THEME);
```

### Review: Optional chaining

Optional chaining is a way to safely access deeply nested properties in an object. This approach can help us avoid the errors that occur when attempting to access `undefined` or `null` properties.

Consider a scenario where we attempt to access a property that doesn't exist, which normally results in an error:

```javascript
const adventurer = {
  name: 'Alice',
};

console.log(adventurer.dog.name); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
```

In this application, it's probable that the `dog` property might be added in later. This is where some optional chaining might prove useful.

Using `console.log(adventurer.dog?.name);` will allow our code to run without an error:

```javascript
const adventurer = {
  name: 'Alice',
};

let dog = adventurer.dog?.name;

console.log(dog); // undefined
```

Now, the non existent property causes an error. Instead our code logs a value of `undefined`.

### Exercise 11: Optional chaining

```js
// Now check for `cat.age` on `adventurer`. See how it errors out? Use optional chaining in a console.log that it returns undefined instead.

const adventurer = {
  name: 'Alice',
};

let cat; // Your code here

console.log(cat);
```
